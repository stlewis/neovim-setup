# Steve's NeoVim

This repository exists to give me portable access to my neovim setup so that I can drop it on whatever servers I happen to need it. Basic installation steps are as follows:

1. Make sure you have the latest stable version of NeoVim installed. As of this writing, that is 0.9.1
2. Clone this repository into the config directory for nvim. On Linux/Mac OS systems that is `~/.config/nvim`
3. Start NeoVim. This will kick off the plugin manager installation process
4. Profit
